# Google-Chat-Dark
An official-looking dark theme for Google Chat.

## Usage
Install the Stylus browser extension, and then click here:

[Install Theme](https://github.com/loganswartz/Google-Chat-Dark/raw/main/google-chat-dark.user.css)

## Miscellaneous
This style was initially based on the
[GO-Ventura-Dark](https://github.com/Alorse/GO-Ventura-Google-Chat) theme,
mainly to avoid needing to manually discover all the CSS selectors myself when
someone else has already done the work. I've since changed a good portion of
the style rules and added quite a few new selectors and rules to make the style
more cohesive.
